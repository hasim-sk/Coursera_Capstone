## Notebooks for Week 3 Peer Graded assignment
This folder contains notebooks for Week 3 peer graded assignment in the course of IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project.

### Notebook Week 3.1:
This notebook contains the codes to scrape the Wikipedia page and build the cleaned version of the data. I've used pandas package to scrape the table, since it is easier and  not much of complicated codes were needed to scrape. The link which is scapped: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M

### Notebook Week 3.2:
This notebook focuses on getting the latitude and longitude data of a certain location. But since geocoder is not such a reliable package to get the location data and it is much slower i didn't use this package; instead i used the location data that was provided.
